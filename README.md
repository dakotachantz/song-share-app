# State, Props, and Forms
In this project, you will work with using state, props, and forms to create an application that shares the song you are listening to or suggesting to other users.

### Objectives
---
This project is about managing state, props, lifecycles, and forms. The following should be true of your application:

1. Your `PlayListcomponent` should pass down the state in the form of props to your `PlayListItem` component which will render the actual play list entries.
2. Your `App.js` component should only have import statements for your `NavBar`, `PlayList`, and `PlayListForm`.
3. The state for your `PlayListForm` component should have `userName`, `songArtist`, `songTitle`, and `songNotes`.
4. The state for your `PlayList` should just have one key value pair, songs.

5. The styling is up to you, but please make this a polished product!
